# Unsupervise# 🛍️ Mall Customer Segmentation using K-Means

This project implements **Customer Segmentation** using the **K-Means Clustering algorithm** on the Mall Customers dataset and provides an **interactive Streamlit web application** for cluster prediction and visualization.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Customer segmentation helps businesses understand different types of customers based on their behavior.  
In this project, customers are grouped based on:

- **Annual Income (k$)**
- **Spending Score (1–100)**

The trained K-Means model predicts which cluster a new customer belongs to.
